# API Architecture Explanation for Product Manager Interview

## Opening - Setting the Business Context (1 minute)

"As the Product Manager for this experimentation platform, I worked closely with engineering to design APIs that balance three critical business needs: **developer adoption**, **enterprise security requirements**, and **platform scalability**.

Our platform serves two distinct user personas - internal teams running experiments and external developers integrating our platform into their applications. This drove many of our architectural decisions around API design, authentication models, and performance optimization."

## Business-Driven API Strategy (2-3 minutes)

### Product Vision & API Design Philosophy

"Our API strategy was built around the principle of **'Progressive Complexity'** - simple operations should be simple, but complex enterprise workflows should be fully supported.

**Core Business Requirements:**
1. **Time-to-Integration**: Developers need to get value in under 30 minutes
2. **Enterprise Security**: SOC2 compliance with audit trails and role-based access
3. **Scale Economics**: Support freemium users while handling enterprise volumes
4. **Platform Stickiness**: APIs that encourage deeper platform adoption

**This translated to specific API design decisions:**

```
Simple Use Case: Feature Flag Check
GET /api/v1/feature-flags/my-feature/evaluate?user_id=123
→ Single API call, immediate value

Complex Use Case: A/B Test with Targeting
POST /api/v1/experiments/create
→ Rich targeting rules, statistical configuration, webhook integration
```

### Developer Experience as Product Strategy

"I championed developer experience as a core product differentiator:

**DX Principles:**
- **Predictable Patterns**: All endpoints follow consistent REST conventions
- **Self-Documenting**: Interactive Swagger docs with real examples
- **Error Recovery**: Detailed error messages with suggested fixes
- **SDK-First**: Auto-generated SDKs for major languages

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Competitors required 2-3 days for integration; we achieved 30-minute onboarding
- Our error messages include documentation links and troubleshooting steps
- Real-time testing in Swagger UI without requiring production setup"

## Business-Informed Technical Architecture (3-4 minutes)

### Market Research Driving Technical Decisions

"I conducted extensive competitive analysis and customer interviews that informed our technical architecture:

**Customer Pain Points Discovered:**
1. **Latency Sensitivity**: 67% of enterprise customers cited API latency as a deal-breaker
2. **Integration Complexity**: Most platforms required 5+ API calls for basic workflows
3. **Security Concerns**: 45% of enterprise deals stalled on security reviews
4. **Cost Predictability**: Usage-based pricing created budget uncertainty

**How We Addressed These:**

**1. Dual-Architecture for Performance vs. Features**
```
High-Performance Track: Lambda Functions + DynamoDB
- Feature flag evaluations: <10ms response time
- Designed for 100M+ daily requests
- Cost-optimized with auto-scaling

Full-Feature Track: ECS + PostgreSQL
- Complex experiment management
- Rich analytics and reporting
- Comprehensive audit logging
```

**Business Impact**: This allowed us to offer both freemium (fast, simple) and enterprise (comprehensive, secure) tiers.

**2. Authentication Strategy Balancing Security & UX**
```
OAuth2 for Platform Users:
- Full audit trail for compliance
- Integration with customer SSO systems
- Progressive permissions (viewer → experimenter → admin)

API Keys for Client Applications:
- Simple integration for developers
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Scoped permissions for security
```

**Business Impact**: 40% faster enterprise sales cycles due to pre-approved security model.

### Data Architecture Reflecting Business Model

"Our data architecture directly supports our business model and customer segmentation:

**Freemium Users (Cost-Optimized)**:
- DynamoDB for high-volume, low-cost operations
- Basic analytics with 30-day retention
- Shared infrastructure with throttling

**Enterprise Users (Feature-Rich)**:
- PostgreSQL for complex queries and reporting
- Unlimited data retention with export capabilities
- Dedicated Redis instances for performance

**Growth Users (Hybrid)**:
- Intelligent routing based on feature usage
- Gradual migration path to enterprise features
- Cost modeling that encourages upgrade"

## Product-Driven Engineering Decisions (3-4 minutes)

### API Versioning Strategy for Product Evolution

"I worked with engineering to design a versioning strategy that supports rapid product iteration while maintaining customer stability:

**Version Strategy:**
```
/api/v1/ - Stable, long-term support (18+ months)
/api/v2/ - New features, backward compatibility warnings
/api/beta/ - Experimental features for early adopters
```

**Business Benefits:**
- Early adopters get competitive advantages through beta APIs
- Enterprises get stability guarantees
- Product team can iterate rapidly without breaking existing integrations

**Deprecation Process:**
1. **6 months notice** via API headers and developer communications
2. **Migration tools** and documentation
3. **Customer success support** for enterprise accounts
4. **Gradual sunset** with usage monitoring"

### Analytics-Driven API Design

"Every API endpoint includes instrumentation that feeds back into product decisions:

**Key Metrics We Track:**
```python
# Example: Feature Flag Evaluation Endpoint
{
    "endpoint": "/feature-flags/evaluate",
    "response_time": "12ms",
    "cache_hit_rate": "94%",
    "error_rate": "0.02%",
    "user_tier": "enterprise",
    "feature_complexity": "advanced_targeting"
}
```

**Product Insights:**
- **Usage Patterns**: 80% of API calls are simple boolean flags → prioritize performance here
- **Error Analysis**: Most errors from misconfigured targeting rules → improve UX/documentation
- **Feature Adoption**: Advanced features correlate with higher retention → focus sales enablement
- **Performance Impact**: Enterprise customers 3x more sensitive to latency → dedicated infrastructure"

### Monetization Through API Design

"The API architecture directly supports our revenue model:

**Freemium Boundaries:**
```
Free Tier Limits:
- 100K API calls/month
- 5 active experiments
- 30-day data retention
- Community support

Growth Tier Features:
- 10M API calls/month
- Advanced targeting rules
- 90-day retention
- Email support

Enterprise Capabilities:
- Unlimited API calls
- SSO integration

- Dedicated support
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Middleware tracks usage by customer tier
- Graceful degradation rather than hard limits
- Upgrade prompts at logical usage points
- Self-service upgrade flow through API"

## Cross-Functional Engineering Considerations (3-4 minutes)

### Security as Product Enabler, Not Blocker

"Security requirements often conflict with developer experience, so I worked to make security feel transparent:

**Enterprise Security Requirements:**
- SOC2 Type II compliance
- GDPR data handling
- Role-based access control
- Complete audit logging

**Developer-Friendly Implementation:**
```
# Security that doesn't hurt DX
Authorization: Bearer {token}  # Industry standard
X-API-Key: {key}              # Simple for client apps

# Audit logging that helps developers
{
    "action": "experiment_created",
    "user": "john@company.com",
    "resource": "exp_123",
    "debug_info": "Created via API v1.2.3"
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- 60% reduction in security review time for enterprise deals
- Zero customer churn due to security incidents
- Self-service compliance documentation reduces sales cycles"

### Reliability Engineering for Customer Trust

"API reliability directly impacts customer retention and expansion:

**Reliability Targets:**
- 99.9% uptime SLA (enterprise requirement)
- <100ms P95 response time (competitive necessity)
- Zero data loss (compliance requirement)

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Circuit Breaker Pattern:
- API calls fail gracefully to cached responses
- Customer applications continue working during incidents
- Automatic recovery when services restore

Multi-Region Deployment:
- Active-passive setup with 30-second failover
- Data replication with eventual consistency
- Customer-transparent disaster recovery
```

**Customer Impact:**
- Customer-reported incidents down 85% year-over-year
- Enterprise renewal rate improved from 89% to 96%
- Net Promoter Score among API users: 8.2/10"

### Performance Engineering for Competitive Advantage

"API performance is a key competitive differentiator in our market:

**Performance Strategy:**
```
Tiered Performance Architecture:
- P95 <10ms: Feature flag evaluations (competitive necessity)
- P95 <100ms: Experiment management (user experience)
- P95 <1s: Analytics queries (acceptable for complexity)

Caching Strategy:
- 95% cache hit rate reduces infrastructure costs 60%
- Smart invalidation prevents stale data issues
- Customer-specific cache partitioning for multi-tenancy
```

**Business Results:**
- 25% higher conversion rate from trial to paid (attributed to performance)
- Largest enterprise customer processes 50M daily requests without performance complaints
- Infrastructure costs 40% lower than projected due to caching efficiency"

## Product Roadmap & Technical Strategy (2-3 minutes)

### Data-Driven API Evolution

"I use API analytics to drive product roadmap decisions:

**Usage Data Insights:**
- 78% of API calls use only 20% of available features → simplify core APIs
- Advanced users make 10x more API calls → focus on power user features
- Mobile SDK usage growing 300% YoY → prioritize mobile-specific optimizations
- Webhook usage correlates with 2x higher retention → expand event system

**Roadmap Priorities:**
1. **GraphQL Layer**: Customer requests for flexible queries (Q2)
2. **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket support for live experiment data (Q3)
3. **AI-Powered APIs**: Automatic experiment optimization suggestions (Q4)
4. **Global Edge**: CDN-based evaluation for international customers (Q1 next year)"

### Technical Debt vs. Feature Velocity

"I balance technical debt with feature delivery through API design:

**Strategic Technical Investments:**
- **Database optimization**: 50% response time improvement enables new real-time features
- **Async processing**: Background job system supports complex analytics without blocking APIs
- **Schema evolution**: Database migrations enable rapid feature iteration
- **Monitoring infrastructure**: Proactive incident detection reduces customer-reported issues

**Business Justification:**
- Every 10ms latency improvement = 2% conversion rate increase
- Reliable APIs reduce customer success burden by 30%
- Good monitoring prevents incidents that could lose enterprise deals"

## API Endpoint Structure & Business Logic

### Core API Organization

"Our API is organized around business domains, not technical architecture:

```
/api/v1/
├── /experiments        # A/B test lifecycle management
├── /feature-flags      # Feature toggle operations
├── /tracking          # Event collection & analytics
├── /assignments       # User-to-variant mapping
├── /results           # Statistical analysis & reporting
├── /users             # Account & team management
├── /admin             # System administration
├── /safety            # Monitoring & rollback controls
├── /metrics           # Performance & usage analytics
└── /utils             # Helper functions (sample size calc)
```

**Business Rationale:**
- Domain boundaries match customer mental models
- Each endpoint group serves specific user workflows
- Clear separation enables team ownership and scaling"

### Authentication Strategy for Different Use Cases

"We implemented dual authentication to serve different integration patterns:

**OAuth2 + JWT (Human Users):**
```
POST /api/v1/auth/token
{
  "username": "pm@company.com",
  "password": "secure_password"
}

Response:
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "user_role": "experimenter"
}
```

**API Keys (Applications):**
```
GET /api/v1/feature-flags/new-checkout/evaluate?user_id=12345
Headers:
  X-API-Key: sk_live_123abc456def789...

Response (< 10ms):
{
  "enabled": true,
  "variant": "treatment_b",
  "assignment_id": "assign_789xyz"
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- Human workflow: Rich permissions, audit trails, collaboration features
- Application workflow: Ultra-fast evaluation, simple integration, high throughput"

## Testing Strategy, Collaboration, Definition of Done, and Acceptance Criteria

### Testing Strategy (shift-left to production)

1. Spec and Schema Validation (Shift-left)
- OpenAPI spec linting and consistency checks during PRs (style, versioning, errors, pagination).
- Pydantic schema validation and request/response validation in FastAPI.
- Backward-compatibility checks on public endpoints before merges.

2. Automated Test Pyramid
- Unit tests: services, rules engines, and utilities (`backend/app/services`, `backend/app/core`).
- Integration tests: endpoint + DB/cache path using seeded data (`backend/tests/unit/api` and `backend/tests/unit/models`).
- Contract tests: provider verifies consumer expectations for SDKs and webhooks.
- End-to-end smoke: critical user journeys (auth → create experiment → start → evaluate → record events → results).
- Performance tests: k6/Gatling for p95/p99, throughput, and soak; budgets by domain (evaluation <10ms p95; management <100ms p95; analytics <1s).
- Resiliency tests: retry/backoff, circuit breaker behavior, cache fallback, failure injection for external deps.
- Security tests: authZ matrix by role, scope enforcement, input fuzzing, secrets scanning.

3. Data and Migration Testing
- Alembic migration validity and downgrade paths are verified in CI (see `backend/tests/models/test_alembic_migration.py`).
- Referential integrity and data backfill jobs tested with sample fixtures.

4. CI/CD Quality Gates
- All tests green; coverage threshold met (e.g., 80%+ for core services).
- Linting/static analysis pass; no critical vulnerabilities in dependency scans.
- Spec compatibility and deprecation checks pass; changelog updated when required.
- Canary smoke tests run post-deploy; automatic rollback on SLO breach.

5. Environments and Data
- Sandbox/dev with seeded datasets for rapid local validation.
- Staging mirrors prod configs for realistic performance baselines.
- Deterministic fixtures for reproducible test runs.

### How I Worked with Developers

- Planning and Discovery
  - Joint backlog grooming translating PRD into epics/stories with NFRs and measurable outcomes.
  - Architecture/design reviews with clear decision logs and tradeoffs.

- API Design and Governance
  - Lightweight RFCs for new resources or breaking changes; async review within 48 hours.
  - Style guide enforcement via automated linters and a rotating API review board.

- Delivery Rituals
  - Daily async updates; weekly demo/QA; office hours for integration teams.
  - Pairing on complex flows (auth, caching, schedulers) and incident retros with action items.

- Developer Experience
  - Provide endpoint examples, Postman collections, and SDK stubs aligned to OpenAPI.
  - Ensure observability scaffolding (request IDs, metrics, logs) is included from day one.

### Definition of Done (DoD)

- Functionality
  - Endpoint behavior matches the API design doc and OpenAPI spec; examples added/updated.
  - Idempotency, pagination, filtering, and stable error codes implemented where applicable.

- Quality and Performance
  - Unit/integration/contract tests added; all pass in CI; coverage threshold met.
  - Performance budgets met (per-endpoint p95) in staging; no regressions against baseline.

- Security and Compliance
  - AuthN/AuthZ checks and role scopes enforced; audit logs emitted for sensitive actions.
  - PII handling verified (masking/encryption) and input validation in place.

- Observability and Operations
  - Structured logs, metrics, and traces wired; dashboards and alerts updated if needed.
  - Runbooks and on-call notes updated; feature flags and rate limits configured.

- Documentation and Developer Experience
  - API reference + how-to guide updated; SDKs regenerated/updated; changelog entry added.
  - Deprecation or migration notes included when relevant.

### Acceptance Criteria (examples)

1. Feature Flag Evaluation
- Given a valid API key and existing flag, when the client calls `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/{key}/evaluate?user_id={id}` then:
  - Response returns in <10ms p95 on staging with warmed cache.
  - Body includes `enabled` and `variant`; assignments are sticky for the same `user_id`.
  - On cache miss, system falls back to Redis → DB and warms caches.
  - On rate limit breach, returns 429 with `Retry-After` and correlation `X-Request-ID` header.

2. Experiment Creation
- Given an authenticated user with EXPERIMENTER role, when posting valid payload to `/api/v1/experiments` then:
  - 201 with created resource; invalid payload returns 400 with structured error and doc link.
  - Audit log entry recorded with user, action, resource, and request metadata.
  - Related caches invalidated (user_experiments, experiment lists) within the same transaction.

3. Access Control
- Given a VIEWER role, write operations (create/update/delete) on experiments return 403 with `PERMISSION_DENIED` code.
- Role changes propagate within 5 minutes due to permission cache TTL.

4. Migrations
- Applying the Alembic migration against a copy of prod schema succeeds and is reversible.
- No p95 regression >10% on impacted endpoints after deployment.

5. Documentation and SDKs
- OpenAPI spec updated; examples present; Postman collection updated.
- JS and Python SDK methods generated/updated with usage snippets.

## Interview Q&A Appendix

### Common Follow-up Questions (with succinct answers)

- Why dual authentication (OAuth2/JWT + API Keys)?
  - Humans need rich permissions and auditability → OAuth2/OIDC via Cognito with JWTs and RBAC. High-throughput app calls need ultra-low latency → scoped API keys with per-key rate limits. Implemented in `backend/app/api/deps.py` and enforced by `backend/app/core/permissions.py`.

- How do you achieve sub-10ms flag evaluation?
  - Three-tier caching (in-memory → Redis → DB), precompiled targeting rules, minimized I/O, and a serverless path (Lambda + DynamoDB) for horizontal scale. See "Performance Considerations" and Lambda under `backend/lambda/feature_flag_evaluation`.

- What is your error strategy and developer ergonomics?
  - Standard Problem+JSON with stable codes, actionable messages, documentation links, and `X-Request-ID` correlation. Global handlers and error middleware ensure consistency.

- How do you manage breaking changes and versioning?
  - `/api/beta` for early adopters, `/api/v1` for stability, `/api/v2` for evolution. Deprecation via headers, 6–12 month windows, migration guides, and usage monitoring. Compat checks run in CI.

- How is RBAC enforced across domains?
  - Resource/Action matrices with hierarchical checks (superuser → owner → role). Permission caching in Redis with short TTL. Core logic in `backend/app/core/permissions.py`.

- Rate limiting and idempotency?
  - Per-tenant and per-key limits at the edge with clear 429 semantics and `Retry-After`. Idempotency keys for mutating endpoints to ensure safe retries.

- Testing strategy highlights?
  - Shift-left spec validation, unit/integration/contract tests, E2E smoke, k6/Gatling performance budgets, resiliency and security tests, and migration verification in CI.

- Definition of Done?
  - Spec parity and examples; tests + coverage thresholds; performance budgets met; AuthN/Z and audit logging; observability wired; docs/SDKs/changelog updated; runbooks ready.

### Additional Interview Questions You Can Expect

- How do you trade off performance versus consistency in evaluation vs. management paths?
- Describe your API governance process and how you enforce standards at scale.

- **Webhook architecture**: Customer demand for real-time integration came sooner than expected
- **GraphQL layer**: Power users needed flexible querying capabilities from day one
- **Cost monitoring**: Customers want predictable billing - build usage alerts early
- **Mobile optimization**: Mobile SDK adoption exceeded projections by 300%

**Product Strategy Adjustments:**
- **Community building**: Developer community became our best sales channel
- **Partner ecosystem**: Third-party integrations drive significant enterprise adoption
- **International expansion**: API performance varies dramatically by geography

Create and apply a database migration safely.

Generate a new Alembic migration, review it for accuracy, and apply it to the database.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (required - migration description)

Steps to execute:
1. Set required environment variables: POSTGRES_DB=experimentation and POSTGRES_SCHEMA=experimentation
2. Generate migration using: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "$ARGUMENTS"
3. CRITICAL: Review the generated migration file carefully for:
   - Correct down_revision pointing to the right previous migration ID
   - Accurate schema changes matching your model changes
   - Proper table names with schema prefix
   - No unintended drops or alterations
4. Apply the migration: python -m alembic -c app/db/alembic.ini upgrade head
5. Verify successful application with: alembic current
6. Display migration history with: alembic history --verbose | head -20

Safety checks:
- Always verify down_revision chain integrity
- Check for "multiple heads" errors
- Review autogenerated code for complex changes
- Ensure schema is set correctly in all operations

Example usage:
- /migration "add user preferences table"
- /migration "add index on experiment_assignments user_id"

# Scratchpads Directory

This directory is used for communication between Claude instances during multi-Claude workflows.

## Purpose

When running multiple Claude instances in parallel (e.g., PLANNER, IMPLEMENTER, TESTER, REVIEWER, REFACTORER), they communicate via scratchpad files written to this directory.

## Usage

Each Claude instance:
- **Reads** relevant scratchpads to understand what others have done
- **Writes** its own scratchpad to share progress/findings with others

## Example Files

During EP-010 Phase 4, you might see:
- `ep010-phase4-plan.md` - PLANNER's implementation plan
- `implementation-log.md` - IMPLEMENTER's progress log
- `test-results.md` - TESTER's test results and failures
- `review.md` - REVIEWER's code review feedback
- `refactoring-log.md` - REFACTORER's fix log
- `final-validation.md` - TESTER's final validation report
- `final-review.md` - REVIEWER's final approval/concerns

## Cleanup

After completing a task:
1. Archive scratchpads to `.claude/archive/<task-name>/`
2. Commit the archive for future reference
3. Clear this directory for the next task

# Experimentation Platform Changes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Rules Engine Test Failures
The unit tests for the rules engine were failing due to incorrect imports and usage of functions that don't exist in the implementation.

### 2. Experiment Scheduler Behavior
The experiment scheduler had a logic issue where the same experiment was being processed in both the activation and completion loops, causing experiments to be incorrectly marked as COMPLETED when they should be ACTIVE.

## Changes Made

### Rules Engine Test Fix

1. **Import Corrections**:
   - Removed the non-existent imports `rules_engine` and `EvaluationContext` from `backend/tests/unit/core/test_rules_engine.py`
   - Used the actual functions from the module directly: `evaluate_targeting_rules`, `evaluate_rule`, etc.

2. **Test Function Calls**:
   - Updated all test calls to match the actual function signatures
   - Changed function call patterns from:
     ```python
     context = EvaluationContext(user_id=USER_ID, attributes=PREMIUM_USER_CONTEXT)
     rules_engine._evaluate_condition(condition, context)
     ```
     to the correct pattern:
     ```python
     evaluate_condition(condition, PREMIUM_USER_CONTEXT)
     ```

3. **User Context Updates**:
   - Added `user_id` to test contexts to ensure correct evaluation
   - Updated assertion patterns to work with the actual return types

4. **Handled Null Returns**:
   - Added null checks for targeting rule results to prevent errors accessing attributes on `None`

### Experiment Scheduler Fix

1. **Process Flow Correction**:
   - Added a commit for activation changes before checking for experiments to complete
   - This prevents the same experiment from being processed in both the activation and completion loops
   - Updated commit messages to reflect what is being committed

2. **Improved Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging to better indicate how many experiments were activated vs. completed

## Test Results

### Rules Engine Tests
- 24 tests now pass successfully
- The test coverage for `backend/app/core/rules_engine.py` increased to 62%

### Experiment Scheduler Tests
- All 5 tests for the experiment scheduler now pass successfully
- The test coverage for `backend/app/core/scheduler.py` is 64%

## Remaining Issues

- There are still some linter errors regarding the non-resolvable `pytest` import, which appears to be an IDE-specific issue
- 5 tests are failing in the authentication dependency module, but these are unrelated to our fixes and involve mock objects missing the `role` attribute

## Conclusion

The core functionality for both the rules engine and experiment scheduler has been fixed and is now properly tested. The rules engine correctly evaluates targeting rules against user contexts, and the experiment scheduler correctly transitions experiments between states based on their scheduled dates.

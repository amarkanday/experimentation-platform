## Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch (Networking)

"We're building Experimently, an AWS-native A/B testing and feature flag platform. Think LaunchDarkly, but built specifically for AWS infrastructure—50% cheaper, faster integration, and <50ms latency. We're in beta with 20 design partners. Are you using any experimentation tools currently?"

### 1-Minute Pitch (Discovery Call Intro)

"Experimently is an AWS-native experimentation platform for engineering teams that want to ship features faster and safer.

The problem: Tools like LaunchDarkly and Statsig are expensive ($500-$2K/month), slow to integrate (2-3 days), and don't integrate natively with AWS infrastructure.

Our solution: We built Experimently on AWS from the ground up—Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis. You get the same features (A/B testing, feature flags, advanced targeting) at 50% the cost, with 30-minute integration and <50ms latency.

We're in beta with 20 design partners, including [notable company names]. Looking for 30 more to help shape the product. Interested in learning more?"

### 3-Minute Pitch (Demo Intro)

"Thanks for taking the time. Let me give you some context before we dive into the demo.

**The Problem:**
Most engineering teams we talk to are frustrated with experimentation tools. They're either:
1. Paying $500-$2K/month for LaunchDarkly or Statsig (and costs keep going up)
2. Spending weeks integrating and training their team
3. Dealing with performance issues (100-200ms latency adds up)
4. Struggling with AWS integration (third-party tools add complexity)

**Our Solution:**
We built Experimently specifically for AWS-heavy teams. It's built on AWS primitives—Lambda for real-time evaluation, DynamoDB for fast storage, Kinesis for event streaming.

**The Results:**
- 50% cost reduction vs. competitors
- 30-minute integration (vs. 2-3 days)
- <50ms P99 latency (vs. 100-200ms)
- Native AWS integration (no extra complexity)

**Where We Are:**
We're in beta with 20 design partners, ranging from 10-person startups to 300-person companies. Getting great feedback—80% activation rate, 95% say they'd recommend us.

**Today's Goal:**

### Investor Pitch (5-Minute)

**The Opportunity:**
The experimentation software market is $1.08B and growing at 12.5% annually. Every product team needs A/B testing and feature flags—it's table stakes.

**The Problem:**
Incumbents (LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, Statsig) are expensive, slow to integrate, and built for a generic cloud. 78% of enterprises use AWS, but no one has built an AWS-native experimentation platform.

**Our Solution:**
Experimently is the first AWS-native experimentation platform. We deliver enterprise-grade features at 50% the cost with 10x better performance.

**Why Now:**
1. **Cloud Migration:** Companies are consolidating on AWS, want AWS-native tools
2. **Cost Optimization:** Economic uncertainty driving search for cheaper alternatives
3. **Product-Led Growth:** More teams need self-serve experimentation

**Traction:**
- 20 design partners in 6 weeks
- 80% activation rate (industry avg: 30-40%)
- <50ms P99 latency (fastest in market)
- $0 customer acquisition cost (product-led growth)

**Business Model:**
Freemium → PLG → Enterprise
- Free tier: 10K events/month
- Pro: $99/month (target: 1,000 customers in 24 months)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (target: 50 customers in 24 months)

**Ask:**
Raising $1M seed to:
1. Build out sales and marketing ($400K)
2. Expand engineering team ($400K)
3. Launch AWS Marketplace partnership ($100K)
4. Operations and buffer ($100K)

## Objection Handling

### "We're already using LaunchDarkly and it works fine."

**Response:**
"That's great! LaunchDarkly is a solid tool. A few questions:

1. Are you happy with the pricing? Most teams tell us they're paying $500-$2K/month.
2. How was the integration process? Did it take longer than expected?
3. Have you noticed any latency issues with feature flag evaluation?

The reason I ask: We've helped several teams migrate from LaunchDarkly and save 50-60% on costs while improving performance. Plus, if you're on AWS, you get better integration.

Would it be worth a quick 15-minute call to show you a side-by-side comparison? No pressure—if LaunchDarkly is working great, stick with it. But if you're open to reducing costs, it's worth a look."

### "We don't have time to switch tools right now."

**Response:**
"Totally understand—switching tools is a pain. The good news: We have a migration guide that makes it pretty painless. Most teams are up and running in under 2 hours.

Here's how it works:
1. Import your existing flags from LaunchDarkly (we have a script)
2. Update your SDK integration (usually a drop-in replacement)
3. Run in parallel for a week to verify
4. Cut over when you're confident

But I get it—if now's not the right time, no worries. Mind if I check back in 3-6 months?

In the meantime, would you be open to a quick demo? Even if you don't switch now, it's good to know what's out there. Takes 20 minutes."

### "We're thinking about building this in-house."

**Response:**
"I totally understand the appeal—you can build exactly what you need. A few things to consider:

**Build Cost:**
- Initial build: 3-6 months of eng time (~$50K-$150K in fully-loaded cost)
- Ongoing maintenance: ~$20K-$50K/year
- Opportunity cost: What else could your team build instead?

**Build vs. Buy:**
With Experimently, you get:
- Enterprise-grade features on day 1 (not 6 months)
- $99/month ($1,188/year vs. $70K+ to build + maintain)
- We handle reliability, scaling, security, compliance
- Your team focuses on building your product

**When Build Makes Sense:**
If you have truly unique requirements (e.g., gaming at 1M+ RPS, complex statistical models), building might make sense.

For 95% of use cases, buying is 50x cheaper and 10x faster.

Want to see a demo to help inform your build-vs-buy decision?"

### "This is too expensive."

**Response:**
"I appreciate the honesty. Can I ask: what's your budget for experimentation tooling?

[Listen to their answer]

A few points for context:

**Compared to Competitors:**
- LaunchDarkly: $500-$2K/month minimum
- Statsig: $150-$500/month
- Experimently: $99/month (or free for early partners)

**Compared to Building:**
- Build in-house: $50K-$150K initial + $20K-$50K/year maintenance
- Experimently: $1,188/year

**ROI:**
If running experiments helps you ship even one winning feature that boosts revenue by $5K/year, Experimently pays for itself 5x over.

**Options:**
1. Free tier (10K events/month)—perfect for getting started
2. Design partner program (free for 6-12 months)
3. Startup discount (50% off if you're pre-Series A)

Which of those sounds most interesting?"

### "We need feature X that you don't have."

**Response:**
"Great question—what's the specific use case for feature X?

[Listen to their answer]

A few options:

**Option 1: It's on Our Roadmap**
"Good news! Feature X is on our roadmap for Q2. As a design partner, you'd get early access and could help shape how it works."

**Option 2: Workaround Exists**
"We don't have that exact feature, but here's how you can achieve the same outcome: [explain workaround]. Would that work for your use case?"

**Option 3: Custom Development**
"That's a great idea! If you become a design partner, we could potentially prioritize building that feature based on your needs. What's your timeline?"

**Option 4: Honest Assessment**
"To be honest, we don't have that feature and it's not on our near-term roadmap. If that's a must-have, [Competitor X] might be a better fit. But for [90% of your use cases], we'd save you money and give you better performance. Worth exploring?"

### "How do I know you'll still be around in 12 months?"

**Response:**
"That's a fair concern—betting on a startup is risky. Here's why I'm confident:

**Traction:**
- 20 design partners in 6 weeks (80% activated)
- $0 CAC (product-led growth is working)
- Strong retention (95% of partners still active)

**Fundamentals:**
- Built on AWS infrastructure (extremely low operating costs)
- Clear path to profitability (unit economics work at scale)
- [Mention any funding/investors if applicable]

**Risk Mitigation for You:**
1. We're SOC2 compliant (you can audit our practices)
2. Data export available (you can migrate if needed)
3. Self-hosted option coming (you control the infrastructure)
4. Design partner program gives you 6-12 months to evaluate

**Reference Customers:**
Happy to introduce you to [Notable Customer] who switched from LaunchDarkly. They had the same concern and can share why they felt confident.

Does that address your concern?"

### "We need SOC2 / HIPAA / [Compliance]"

**Response:**
"Great question—compliance is critical.

**Current State:**
- ✅ SOC2 Type 1 (in progress, completion by Q2 2026)
- ✅ GDPR compliant
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logs
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Encryption at rest and in transit

**HIPAA:**
We don't currently have HIPAA compliance, but it's on our roadmap for H2 2026. If that's a must-have, I can keep you updated on progress.

**Enterprise Security:**
For Enterprise customers, we offer:
- SSO / SAML integration
- Custom data retention policies
- Dedicated infrastructure
- Security review / penetration testing
- BAA (for HIPAA customers)

Would you be open to starting with non-PHI data while we complete HIPAA certification? Or is HIPAA a hard requirement from day 1?"

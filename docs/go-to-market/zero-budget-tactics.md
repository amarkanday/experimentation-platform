Title: [Show & Tell] Built an AWS-native A/B testing platform - Open for feedback

Hey r/aws,

I've been building Experimently, an A/B testing platform designed specifically
for AWS infrastructure. After 6 months of development, we're in beta.

**The problem:** LaunchDarkly/Statsig are expensive and not AWS-native. Building
in-house is complex and time-consuming.

**Our approach:**
- Built on AWS primitives (Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis)
- <50ms P99 latency
- 50% cheaper than LaunchDarkly
- 30-minute integration

**Tech stack:** FastAPI, Aurora, Lambda, DynamoDB, Redis, Next.js

**Looking for:** Feedback on architecture and beta testers

Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation!

Demo: [Link]
Architecture docs: [Link]

[Include architecture diagram]
```

**Technical Help Post:**
```
Title: How we optimized Lambda cold starts to <100ms

[Detailed technical writeup about a specific problem you solved]

By the way, this is what we implemented for Experimently, our AWS-native
experimentation platform. If you're interested: [link]

**Ask for Advice:**
```
Title: Advice needed: AWS architecture for high-throughput event processing

Hey r/aws,

I'm building an A/B testing platform that needs to process 10K+ events/sec
with <50ms latency. Here's my current architecture:

[Diagram]

Looking for feedback on:
1. Is Kinesis overkill for this use case?
2. Should I use DynamoDB or Aurora for event storage?
3. Any gotchas with Lambda at this scale?

Background: [Context about your platform]

Appreciate any insights!

## Social Media Strategy

### LinkedIn Strategy (Primary Channel)

#### Profile Optimization

**Headline:**
"Building AWS-native experimentation platform | Helping teams ship faster with A/B testing & feature flags | Open for beta partners"

**About Section:**
```
I'm building Experimently, an AWS-native experimentation platform that helps
engineering teams ship features faster and with more confidence.

Previously: [Your background]

Currently working on:
• A/B testing infrastructure for AWS-heavy companies
• Making experimentation accessible to teams of all sizes
• Writing about AWS architecture, product development, and building in public

Looking to connect with:
• Engineering leaders at AWS-heavy companies
• Product managers running experiments
• DevOps engineers interested in feature flags

DM me if you want to chat about experimentation, AWS, or building SaaS products!
```

**Featured Section:**
- Link to Experimently website
- Link to best blog post
- Link to demo video
- Link to beta signup

#### LinkedIn Content Calendar

**Monday: Technical Insight**
```
We just optimized our Lambda cold starts from 200ms to <50ms. Here's how:

🔧 1. Minimize dependencies
  - Moved to Lambda layers
  - Lazy-loaded heavy libraries

🔧 2. Connection pooling
  - Reused DynamoDB connections
  - Cached frequently accessed data

🔧 3. Provisioned concurrency
  - Only for critical paths
  - Saved 80% vs. always-on

Result: 75% latency reduction, 40% cost savings.

```

**Wednesday: Building in Public**
```
Week 6 of beta: 15 design partners, 500K events tracked 🎉

What's working:
✅ 30-min onboarding (vs. 2-3 days with competitors)
✅ 80% activation rate (partners creating first experiment)
✅ <50ms P99 latency (10x faster than expected)

What's not working:
❌ Advanced targeting UI is confusing (redesigning)
❌ Documentation gaps (working on video tutorials)
❌ Integration with [Tool X] is clunky (shipping fix next week)

Biggest lesson: Talk to users EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

```

**Friday: Customer Story (with permission)**
```
"We cut our experimentation costs by 60% and improved performance."

That's what [Company Name] told me after switching to Experimently.

Before:
• $2K/month for LaunchDarkly
• 150ms P99 latency
• Complex setup (took 3 days to integrate)

After:
• $800/month with Experimently
• <50ms P99 latency
• Live in production in 45 minutes

The difference? AWS-native architecture.

Feature flag best practice:

Use descriptive keys with prefixes:

❌ new_button
✅ homepage.hero_button.v2

Makes it easy to:
• Find related flags
• Understand context
• Clean up old flags

#FeatureFlags #DevOps
```

**2. Threads (2x per week):**
```
We processed 1 BILLION A/B test events on AWS for under $1,000/month.

Here's the architecture: 🧵

1/ The challenge:
- 10K+ events per second
- <100ms processing time
- Real-time analytics
- Keep costs low

2/ The stack:
API Gateway → Lambda → Kinesis → DynamoDB
         ↓
    CloudWatch → OpenSearch

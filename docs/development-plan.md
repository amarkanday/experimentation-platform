## Parallel Workstreams

To achieve the compressed timeline, these workstreams will run in parallel:

1. **Infrastructure & Backend** (Weeks 1-6)
   - Team: Backend developers, DevOps
   
2. **Frontend Development** (Weeks 5-9)
   - Team: Frontend developers
   
3. **SDK Development** (Weeks 7-9)
   - Team: SDK developers, API specialists

4. **Quality Assurance** (Throughout, intensifying in Weeks 10-12)
   - Team: QA engineers

## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition (Optimized for 12-week timeline)
- 1 Project Manager/Scrum Master
- 3 Backend Developers (Python, AWS)
- 2 Frontend Developers (React, Next.js)
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 QA Engineer
- 1 Technical Writer (part-time, weeks 9-12)

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, AWS SDK
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Next.js, React
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Pytest, Jest, Locust (load testing)

## MVP Feature Prioritization

To meet the 12-week timeline, features are prioritized as follows:

### Priority 1 (Must Have)
- Experiment creation and management
- Basic feature flag functionality
- Real-time experiment assignment
- Event tracking
- Basic statistical analysis
- Core admin interface
- JavaScript SDK

### Priority 2 (Should Have)

- Advanced segmentation
- Integration with third-party analytics

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Compressed timeline causing quality issues | Strong focus on test automation, clear prioritization of features |
| Integration challenges | Early integration testing, clear API contracts |
| Performance bottlenecks | Performance testing starting in week 8, not just at the end |
| Team burnout | Clear scope boundaries, efficient processes, avoid overtime |
| Scope creep | Strict change management, MVP focus |

## Conclusion

This accelerated 12-week plan focuses on delivering a fully functional experimentation platform with core features by running workstreams in parallel and prioritizing MVP functionality. The plan requires disciplined scope management and efficient processes but is achievable with the right team composition and clear prioritization.

Post-launch iterations can address additional features and optimizations based on initial user feedback.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Testing Issues

- **Mock Object Type Mismatch**: When creating mock objects for testing, ensure that the mocks accurately represent the behavior of the real objects they replace, especially when attribute access is involved. See [Experiment Model Test Fix](./experiment_model_test_fix.md).
- **Service Layer Mocking**: Ensure your tests properly mock the service layer behavior to isolate the endpoint testing from actual database access.
- **Authentication Dependencies**: Properly mock authentication dependencies to avoid authentication issues in tests.

### Validation Issues

- **Pydantic Models**: Ensure Pydantic models have correct field types and validation constraints.
- **API Validation**: Add proper request and response validation to endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling for validation errors.

### Logging Issues

- **Middleware Ordering**: Ensure middleware is ordered correctly to capture all requests and responses.
- **Log Format Consistency**: Maintain consistent log formats across different parts of the application.
- **Performance Considerations**: Be mindful of logging overhead in high-traffic components.

### Database Issues

- **Schema Management**: Properly manage database schemas for different environments.
- **Connection Pooling**: Configure connection pooling appropriately for the application's needs.
- **Database Migrations**: Use Alembic for database migrations to maintain schema consistency.

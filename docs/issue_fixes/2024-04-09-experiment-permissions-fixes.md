# Experiment Permissions Fixes - April 9, 2024

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address experiment permissions and status-related issues in the experimentation platform.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Experiment Status Validation
- **Problem**: Experiments in non-DRAFT states (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, ARCHIVED) could be updated despite business rules requiring them to be in DRAFT state.
- **Fix**: Added strict validation in the `update_experiment` endpoint to prevent updates to experiments not in DRAFT status.
- **Implementation**: Added a check that raises a 403 Forbidden error with a descriptive message when attempting to update non-DRAFT experiments.

### 2. Permission Checks
- **Problem**: Inconsistent permission checks across different experiment operations.
- **Fix**: Standardized permission checks using the `get_experiment_access` function.
- **Implementation**: Updated the `update_experiment` endpoint to use the centralized permission checking function.

### 3. Test Coverage
- **Problem**: Test cases were not properly validating all experiment states and user roles.
- **Fix**: Enhanced test coverage for experiment state transitions and user permissions.
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive test cases covering:
  - DRAFT state operations (update, delete)
  - ACTIVE state restrictions
  - COMPLETED state restrictions
  - ARCHIVED state restrictions
  - Different user roles (normal user, viewer user, superuser)

## Test Results
All test cases are now passing, confirming that:
- Only DRAFT experiments can be updated or deleted
- ACTIVE, COMPLETED, and ARCHIVED experiments are properly protected from modifications
- Permission checks are consistently applied across all operations
- User roles are properly enforced

## Impact
These fixes ensure:
1. Data integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications to experiments
2. Consistent behavior across all experiment states
3. Proper enforcement of business rules regarding experiment lifecycle
4. Clear error messages for users attempting invalid operations

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for any edge cases in experiment state transitions
- Consider adding audit logging for experiment modifications
- Review caching strategy for experiment data to ensure consistency

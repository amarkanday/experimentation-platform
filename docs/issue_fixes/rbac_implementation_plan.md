# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the minimum viable product (MVP) plan for implementing a role-based access control system in the experimentation platform.

## Objectives
1. Define clear user roles with distinct permission sets
2. Implement necessary database models to support RBAC
3. Create API endpoints for managing roles and permissions
4. Add role verification throughout the application
5. Ensure the system is testable and maintainable

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Design & Planning (Week 1)
- [x] Define core user roles (Admin, Analyst, Developer, Viewer)
- [x] Map permissions to each role
- [x] Create database schema for roles and permissions
- [x] Design API endpoints for user/role management
- [x] Document authentication flow with RBAC integration

**Deliverable:** Detailed RBAC design document with role definitions and permission matrix

### Phase 2: Database Implementation (Week 2)
- [ ] Create SQL migrations for new tables:
  - `roles` (id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
  - `permissions` (id, name, description, resource, action, created_at, updated_at)
  - `role_permissions` (role_id, permission_id)
  - `user_roles` (user_id, role_id)
- [ ] Update existing `users` table to support roles
- [ ] Create SQLAlchemy models for new tables
- [ ] Add database seed data for default roles and permissions

**Deliverable:** Database migrations and models for RBAC system

### Phase 3: Core API Implementation (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement role management endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/roles - List all roles
  - GET /api/v1/roles/{id} - Get role details
  - POST /api/v1/roles - Create new role
  - PUT /api/v1/roles/{id} - Update role
  - DELETE /api/v1/roles/{id} - Delete role
- [ ] Implement user-role assignment endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/users/{id}/roles - Get user's roles
  - POST /api/v1/users/{id}/roles - Assign role to user
  - DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}/roles/{role_id} - Remove role from user
- [ ] Create Pydantic schemas for request/response validation

**Deliverable:** Working API endpoints for role management

### Phase 4: Permission Enforcement (Week 4)
- [ ] Create permission verification utilities:
  - `has_permission(user_id, resource, action)` function
  - FastAPI dependency for route protection
- [ ] Add permission checks to existing API endpoints
- [ ] Update authentication middleware to include role information in tokens
- [ ] Implement JWT claims for permissions
- [ ] Create error handlers for permission denied cases

**Deliverable:** Permission enforcement system integrated with existing endpoints

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Week 5)
- [ ] Create pytest fixtures for different user roles
- [ ] Write unit tests for permission verification
- [ ] Add integration tests for protected endpoints
- [ ] Update API documentation with role requirements
- [ ] Create user guide for role management

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive test suite and documentation

## Role Definitions

### Admin
- Full system access
- User management (create, update, delete users)
- Role management (assign roles, create custom roles)
- System configuration

### Analyst
- View all experiments and feature flags
- Create and manage analyses
- Access to reporting features
- Cannot modify system configuration

### Developer
- Create and manage experiments and feature flags
- Access to API keys and SDKs
- Limited user management (view only)
- Cannot access system configuration

### Viewer
- Read-only access to experiments and feature flags
- Can view results and reports
- No management capabilities

## Permission Model

Permissions will follow the format: `{resource}:{action}`

Examples:
- `users:create`
- `experiments:read`
- `feature_flags:update`
- `system:configure`

## Testing Strategy

1. Create pytest fixtures for each role type
2. Test API endpoints with different role permissions
3. Verify permission inheritance and overrides
4. Test edge cases (no roles, multiple roles)
5. Performance testing for permission checks

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. Custom role creation
2. Fine-grained permissions at resource instance level
3. Permission groups for easier management
4. Audit logging for permission changes
5. Role-based UI customization

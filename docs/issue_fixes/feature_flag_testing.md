# Feature Flag Testing Issues and Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the issues encountered and fixes implemented while testing the feature flag functionality in the experimentation platform.

## Issues and Fixes

### 1. API Key Authentication
#### Issue
The `test_get_user_flags` test was failing with a 401 Unauthorized error because the test was not properly setting up API key authentication.

#### Fix
- Added proper API key creation in the test setup
- Created a test API key associated with the test user
- Ensured the API key was active and valid
```python
test_api_key = APIKey(
    key="test-api-key",
    name="Test API Key",
    user_id=test_feature_flag.owner_id,
    is_active=True
)
db.add(test_api_key)
db.commit()
```

### 2. Database Session Management
#### Issue
Tests were using inconsistent database sessions, leading to transaction isolation issues and potential data inconsistency.

#### Fix
- Implemented proper session management in the test fixtures
- Created a dedicated `TestingSessionLocal` session factory
- Ensured proper transaction handling with rollback support
```python
TestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(
    autocommit=False,
    autoflush=False,
    bind=test_engine
)
```

### 3. Schema Management
#### Issue
Tests were not consistently using the test schema, leading to potential conflicts with production data.

#### Fix
- Forced the use of 'test_experimentation' schema for all tests
- Added schema verification in test fixtures
- Implemented proper schema cleanup
```python
db_config.get_schema_name = lambda: "test_experimentation"
```

### 4. Debug Fixture Issues
#### Issue
The `debug_db` fixture was failing to properly convert SQLAlchemy Row objects to dictionaries.

#### Fix
- Updated the row to dictionary conversion logic
- Used result object's keys for column names
- Implemented proper data inspection capabilities
```python
column_names = result.keys()
row_dict = dict(zip(column_names, row))
```

### 5. Test Data Cleanup
#### Issue
Test data wasn't being properly cleaned up between test runs, leading to potential test interference.

#### Fix
- Implemented proper transaction rollback in test fixtures
- Added schema dropping option for clean test runs
- Ensured proper connection cleanup
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def db(engine):
    connection = engine.connect()
    transaction = connection.begin()
    session = sessionmaker(bind=connection)()
    yield session
    session.close()
    transaction.rollback()
    connection.close()
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolation**: Each test runs in its own transaction that gets rolled back
2. **Clean State**: Option to drop and recreate schema between test runs
3. **Proper Authentication**: Tests properly mock authentication and API key validation
4. **Data Verification**: Debug fixtures for inspecting database state
5. **Schema Separation**: Dedicated test schema to prevent production data interference

## Coverage Results
- Total test coverage: 48%
- Feature flag endpoint coverage: 67%
- Feature flag service coverage: 61%

## Remaining Warnings

1. SQLAlchemy Deprecation Warnings:
   ```
   The ``declarative_base()`` function is now available as sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base()
   ```
   **Future Fix**: Update to use the new SQLAlchemy 2.0 style declarative base

## Recommendations

1. Increase test coverage for feature flag service
2. Add more edge case testing for feature flag evaluation
3. Implement integration tests for feature flag caching
4. Update SQLAlchemy usage to remove deprecation warnings
5. Add performance testing for feature flag evaluation with large datasets
